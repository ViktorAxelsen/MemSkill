# Capture Action Constraints

## Description

Memory management skill for capturing detailed constraints on actions, including object states and movements, necessary for task completion.

## Purpose

Capture detailed constraints on actions, including object states and movements, necessary for task completion.

## When to Use

- The text chunk mentions constraints on actions, including object states and movements.
- The constraints are crucial for future task steps.

## How to Apply

- Identify the action, its constraints, and relevant object states and movements from the text chunk.
- Create a new memory item with the action-constraint pair, including object states and movements.

## Constraints

- Only capture constraints on actions relevant to the task.
- Update existing constraint memories if new information is provided.

Action type: INSERT only.
